## From MVP to Impact: What We Learned and Where We’re Going

### Initial Feedback

During user testing in Hermosillo:

- 95% found the app intuitive and emotionally meaningful
- 89% said they’d use it as a real solution

One person suggested adding a radius-based alert system and analyzing the probability of pets moving over time — something we’d love to explore with real data.

### Who Benefits

- **Pet owners**: who don’t know where to start
- **Rescues**: overloaded and under-resourced
- **Good citizens**: who want to help but don’t have a channel to act

### Personal Story: After the Hackathon

A few days after the event, we helped rescue a lost husky with an injured leg. We looked through WhatsApp groups, asked neighbors, and eventually reunited her with her family — but it took a lot of coordination and luck. That experience only confirmed how valuable a platform like Patitas Unidas could be.

### What’s Next

- **AI-based image recognition** for visual matching
- **Reward system** to encourage community participation
- **Modules for shelters and adoption**
- **Offline reporting + data sync**
- **Public awareness and responsible ownership campaigns**

### Final Thoughts

Designing a solution like this in under 48 hours was tough. Crafting a business model, designing UX, and building backend services at once is no easy task. But it was worth it.

Patitas Unidas started as a hackathon project — but we believe it can become something more: a useful platform that gives visibility to lost animals, and helps bring them back home.
