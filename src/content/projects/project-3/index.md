This system was designed for a small aesthetic medicine business with limited resources. It uses **AppSheet** as the visual platform and **Apps Script** to extend core functionalities such as automatic folder creation, appointment reports, and data backups.  

The focus was to deliver a **low-cost yet highly functional solution** without sacrificing the level of customization the business required.

Screenshots and demos will be available soon.
